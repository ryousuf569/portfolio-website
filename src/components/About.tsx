          I’m a Computational Mathematics student with a strong interest in building backend systems, 
          data pipelines, and machine-learning tools. Much of my work focuses on learning how to design clean APIs, 
          structure data effectively, and apply models in ways that are both practical and explainable. 
          I enjoy thinking carefully about performance, understanding how models behave rather than treating them as black boxes, 
          and improving my ability to reason about systems end-to-end. Outside of coursework and software projects, 
          I write and produce music, and I enjoy experimenting with creative machine-learning ideas that sit at the intersection of art, 
          mathematics, and technology
